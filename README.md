# STA 523 :: Project

## Requirements

1. Your project must be reproducible.

2. You should include a written report using Rmarkdown detailing your
   project's main objective, data, methods, results, and references.
   I should be able to set `code_folding: hide` in your YAML header or
   `echo = FALSE` in all code chunks and easily read and
   understand your project. Adapt this if doing a Shiny app.

3. Your project must involve some aspect of statistics.

4. You may not use data already used in this course without my approval.

5. You may not use / build on a project from another course without my approval.

6. Your project must include some aspect of R or statistical computing beyond
   what was introduced in this course. For example, this can be an extension of
   some topic or a new package.

7. You must include a `Makefile` that builds your final report by
   connecting all dependencies (not required for a Shiny app).

8. Modify this README so that it provides a brief overview of your project.

9. Set-up a project consultation session with the instructor to outline your
   project's data, objective, and end result. At least two group members
   should attend the meeting.
